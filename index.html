				<p class="text one">Bartolomeu Dias, in full Bartolomeu Dias de Novais, Bartolomeu also spelled
					Bartholomew, Dias also spelled Diaz, (born c. 1450—died May 29, 1500, at sea, near Cape of Good
					Hope), Portuguese navigator and explorer who led the first European expedition to round the Cape of
					Good Hope (1488), opening the sea route to Asia via the Atlantic and Indian oceans. He is usually
					considered to be the greatest of the Portuguese pioneers who explored the Atlantic during the 15th
					century.</p>

				<p class="text two">Almost nothing is known of Dias’s early life. His supposed descent from one of
					Prince
					Henry the Navigator’s pilots is unproved, and his rank was the comparatively modest one of squire of
					the royal household.</p>

				<p class="text three">In 1474 King Afonso V entrusted his son, Prince John (later John II), with the
					supervision of Portugal’s trade with Guinea and the exploration of the western coast of Africa. John
					sought to close the area to foreign shipping and after his accession in 1481 ordered new voyages of
					discovery to ascertain the southern limit of the African continent. The navigators were given stone
					pillars (padrões) to stake the claims of the Portuguese crown. Thus, one of them, Diogo Cão, reached
					the Congo and sailed down the coast of Angola to Cape Santa Maria at 13°26′ S, where he planted one
					of John’s markers. Cão was ennobled and rewarded and sailed again: that time he left a marker at
					15°40′ S and another at Cape Cross, continuing to 22°10′ S. Royal hopes that he would reach the
					Indian Ocean were disappointed, and nothing more is heard of Cão. John II entrusted command of a new
					expedition to Dias. In 1486 rumour arose of a great ruler, the Ogané, far to the east, who was
					identified with the legendary Christian ruler Prester John. John II then sent Pêro da Covilhã and
					one Afonso Paiva overland to locate India and Abyssinia and ordered Dias to find the southern limit
					of Africa.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">The voyage
				</h2>
				<p class="text four">Dias’s fleet consisted of three ships: his own São Cristóvão, the São Pantaleão
					under
					his associate João Infante, and a supply ship under Dias’s brother Pêro (Diogo in some sources). The
					company included some of the leading pilots of the day, among them Pêro de Alenquer and João de
					Santiago, who earlier had sailed with Cão. A 16th-century historian, João de Barros, places Dias’s
					departure in August 1486 and says that he was away 16 months and 17 days, but since two other
					contemporaries, Duarte Pacheco Pereira and Christopher Columbus, put his return in December 1488, it
					is now usually supposed that he left in August 1487.</p>
				<p class="text five">Dias passed Cão’s marker, reaching the “Land of St. Barbara” on December 4, Walvis
					Bay
					on December 8, and the Gulf of St. Stephen (Elizabeth Bay) on December 26. After January 6, 1488, he
					was prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast and sailed south out of sight of land for
					several days. When he again turned to port, no land appeared, and it was only on sailing north that
					he sighted land on February 3. He had thus rounded the Cape without having seen it. He called the
					spot Angra de São Brás (Bay of St. Blaise, whose feast day it was) or the Bay of Cowherds, from the
					people he found there. Dias’s black companions were unable to understand those people, who fled but
					later returned to attack the Portuguese. The expedition went on to Angra da Roca (present-day Algoa
					Bay). The crew was unwilling to continue, and Dias recorded the opinions of all his officers, who
					were unanimously in favour of returning. They agreed to go on for a few days, reaching Rio do
					Infante, named after the pilot of São Pantaleão; this is the present Great Fish (Groot-Vis) River.

				<p class="text six">Faced with strong currents, Dias turned back. He sighted the cape itself in May.
					Barros
					says that he named it Cape of Storms and that John II renamed it Cape of Good Hope. Duarte Pacheco,
					however, attributes the present name to Dias himself, and that is likely, since Pacheco joined Dias
					at the island of Príncipe. Little is known of the return journey except that Dias touched at
					Príncipe, the Rio do Resgate (in the present Liberia), and the fortified trading post of Mina. One
					of Dias’s markers, at Padrão de São Gregório, was retrieved from False Island, about 30 miles (48
					km) short of the Great Fish River, in 1938. Another marker once stood at the western end of the Gulf
					of St. Christopher, since renamed Dias Point.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Later life</h2>
				<p class="text seven">Dias returned to Portugal in December 1488. Nothing is known of Dias’s reception
					by John
					II. Dias was later employed to supervise the construction of the São Gabriel and the São Raphael
					vessels used for Vasco da Gama’s 1497 expedition to India. He was allowed to sail with da Gama’s
					expedition only as far as the Cape Verde Islands. Dias later sailed with Pedro Álvares Cabral, part
					of the expedition that landed on the coast of Brazil on April 22, 1500—Cabral is generally credited
					as the first European to do so—while en route to India. The next month Dias died after his ship was
					lost at sea near the Cape of Good Hope during a storm.</p>
				<p class="text eight">Dias had a son, António, and his grandson, Paulo Dias de Novais, governed Angola
					and
					founded the first European city in Southern Africa, São Paulo de Luanda, in 1576.</p>
